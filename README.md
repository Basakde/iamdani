# i.am.dani

i.am.dani is a creative coding project that celebrates the 40th Anniversary of the creation of the MSX Computer System in 1983. Inspired by DANI chatbot from 1986, i.am.dani celebrates the joy of learning programming by making art from code, and features work by myself and teams of students from TU Dublin. Developed in Java using the Processing libraries for creative coding, i.am.dani features MIDI controlled, sound responsive visual pieces that can be used for visuals for DJ's and live music. Processing can trace it's inspirations from graphical programming languages used to learn programming such as MSX Basic and LOGO as it contains instructions for drawing 2D and 3D shapes, manipulating colors, loading 3D models and making sounds.

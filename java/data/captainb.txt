The decks were stacked
The wind blew low, the wind blew high
The stakes were low, the stakes were high
Upon the my-o-my
Hands low, hands high
Ho-ho-ho, hi-hi-hi
Hands low, hands high
Upon the my-o-my

How was I to know she was so shy?
Upon the my-o-my
Across the light, across the night
You can hear the captain's cry
Hands low, hands high
Upon the my-o-my
Got to make her roll, got to make her fly
Upon the my-o-my

Now tell me, good captain
How does it feel
To be driven away from your own steering wheel
Upon the my-o-my...

They reach their fingers in that ol' sugar bowl
Lick 'em, and sweeten their soul
Little girls and little boys never get old
They know they're bein' naughty
But they love that sugar bowl

It's the same old story
Round the old sugar bowl
It's the same old story
It'll never get old
They know they're bein' naughty
But when it comes to sugar bowls
There's only one world
One sugar bowl

Little girls and little boys never get old
Cause they reach their fingers in that ol' sugar bowl
It's the same old story
Round the old sugar bowl
It's the same old story
It'll never get old

They reach their fingers in that ol' sugar bowl
Lick 'em, and sweeten their soul
Little girls and little boys never get old
They know they're bein' naughty
But they love that sugar bowl
Here we go again, baby
On the new electric ride
Twisting and turning
Over on our side
Here we go around the curve
Ya, we really going to swerve
Oh, I could barely hold my pride
I could barely hold my pride

Rappin' so hard I'm holding my side
With you right by my side
With my baby right by my side
When the machine-guitar stars to playing
We're watching the shooting stars
We're under love's blue sky
On the new electric ride

Think of all the love we've been missing
Then we start to kissing and kissing
I could barely hold my pride
With my baby right by my side
Loop-de-loop
Ride and glide
Swoop-de-swoop
On the new electric ride

With my baby right by my side
I can barely hold my pride
From coast to coast
She loves me the most
Twisting and turning, side by side
My baby loves to hide
On the new electric ride
Up and down, around and round
She loves me the most
On the new electric ride
Up and down, around and round
She loves to hide
On the new electric ride...
Men you been lookin' all around for the women
But they always been right there
Nowadays a woman has to haul off and hit a man
T' make him know she's there
Other night a woman came up 'n hit me
Like I wasn't even there
Yeah, mmm dawned on me, man
That a man been doin' a woman unfair

Y' gotta wait for your woman
Let her know you're there
I knew I had to go out 'n' tell all of the women
That I knew they were there
Now ev'rywhere I go the women all know that I know
Mmm, there ain't no other place to go but there
I'm talkin' about women
Yeah, I'm talkin' about women, man
They don't have to hit me
To make me know it's there
None o' my women have tears in their eyes
You can ask 'em about me I swear
'N they'll tell you
That's one man I swear
Yeah that's a man
'Nuff about tellin' you this

Mmm, y' gotta wait for your woman

Let her know you're there
I knew I had to go out 'n tell all of the women
That I knew they were there
Now ev'rywhere I go the women all know

That I know

There ain't no, there ain't no other place to go but there

I'm talkin' about women
They don't have to hit me, man

To make me know it's there
None o' my women have tears in their eyes
You can ask 'em about me I swear

My smile is stuck
I cannot go back to your Frownland
My spirit's made up of the ocean and the sky
And the sun and the moon
And all my eyes can see

I cannot go back to your land of gloom
Where black jagged shadows
Remind me of the coming of your doom
I want my own land

Take my hand and come with me
It's not too late for you, it is not too late for me
To find my homeland

Where a man can stand by another man
Without an ego flying with no man lying
And no one dying by an earthly hand

Let the devil burn and the beggar learn
And the little girls that live in those old worlds
Take my kind hand

My smile is stuck
I cannot go back to your Frownland
I cannot go back to your Frownland

Dachau blues, those poor Jews
Dachau blues, those poor Jews
Dachau blues, Dachau blues, those poor Jews
Still cryin' 'bout the burnin' back in World War Two's
One mad man, six million lose
Down in Dachau blues, down in Dachau blues

The world can't forget that misery
And the young ones now beggin' the old ones "Please"
To stop bein' madmen
'Fore they have to tell their children 'bout the burnin's back in World War Three's

War One was balls and powder and blood and snow
War Two rained death and showers and skeletons
Dancin' and screamin' and dyin' in the ovens
Cough and smoke and dyin' by the dozens
Down in Dachau blues
Down in Dachau blues

Sweet little children with doves on their shoulders
Their eyes rolled back in ecstasy
Cryin', "Please old man stop this misery."
They're countin' out the devil with two fingers on their hands
Beggin' the Lord don't let the third one land
On World War Three
On World War Three
Moonlight on Vermont affected everybody
Even Mrs. Wooten well as Little Nitty
Even lifebuoy floating with his
Little pistol showing and his little pistol toting
Well, that goes to show you what a moon can do

No more bridge from Tuesday to Friday
Everybody's gone high society

Hope lost his head and got off on alligators
Somebody's leaving peanuts on the curbins for a
White elephant escaped from the zoo with love
Goes to show you what a moon can do
Moonlight on Vermont

Well it did it for lifebuoy and it did it to you
And it did it to zoo and it can do it for me
And it can do it for you
Moonlight on Vermont

Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Don't gimme no affliction
That old time religion
It's good enough for me
Ah, it's good enough for you

Well, come out to show them, come out to show them
Come out to show them, come out to show them
Come out to show them, come out to show them
Come out to show them

Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It's good enough for me

Without your new affliction
Don't need your new restrictions
Gimme that old time religion
It's good enough for me

Moonlight on Vermont
